				<p>While working as Product Manager for Kingsoft in Beijing, China, I was entranced by the developers within my team for their ability to create beautiful, user-friendly applications. After sampling some online courses with Codecademy and Code School, I fell in love and decided to change my career path, actively pursuing web development full-time.  With my ambition, perseverance, and dedication, I have become an expert in front-end development; experienced in Ruby and Ruby on Rails; and proficient with JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and the LAMP stack in MVC frameworks. </p>

				<p>Fully immersing myself in the Atlanta tech community, I regularly attend Meetups to learn new technologies and connect with others with similar passions. I have been able to use what I have learned to help other self-taught developers succeed and regularly lead the Atlanta group of FreeCodeCampers, an <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">online full-stack bootcamp</a>.</p>

				<p>Bringing my ambition and passion for knowledge, my past professional work experience in team-oriented environments, and my adaptability gained from working abroad in international business settings, I am ready to contribute to an engineering team right away. </p>
