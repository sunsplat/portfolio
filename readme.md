My Summary
*******************

While working as Product Manager for Kingsoft in Beijing, China, I was entranced by the developers within my team for their ability to create beautiful, user-friendly applications. I decided to change my career path and actively pursue web development full-time. With my ambition, perseverance, and dedication, I have become an expert in HTML and CSS; knowledgeable in Ruby and Ruby on Rails; and proficient with JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and the LAMP stack in MVC frameworks.  
  
Fully immersing myself in the Atlanta tech community, I regularly attend Meetups to learn new technologies and connect with others with similar passions. I have been able to use what I have learned to help other self-taught developers succeed and regularly lead the local Atlanta chapter of FreeCodeCampers, an online full-stack bootcamp, through their journey.  
  
Bringing my ambition and passion for knowledge, my past professional work experience in team-oriented environments, and my adaptability gained from working abroad in international business settings, I offer a deadly combination that can help your company achieve its goals.
